    "overview": "[Google](/company/google) Chrome is an based on the open source web browser [Chromium](/product/chromium) which is based on Webkit.  It was [accidentally announced](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/09/01/no-joke-google-introduces-its-own-browser-with-a-cartoon/) prematurely on September 1, 2008 and slated for release the following day. It premiered originally on [Windows](/product/windows) only, with Mac OS and Linux versions released in early 2010. \r\n\r\nFeatures include:\r\n\r\n* Tabbed browsing where each tab gets its own process, leading to faster and more stable browsing. If one tab crashes, the whole browser doesn't go down with it\r\n\r\n* A distinct user interface that places tabs on top of the browser window instead of right below the address bar\r\n\r\n* An \"incognito\" mode that lets you browse the web in complete privacy because it doesn't record any of your activity\r\n\r\n* A new JavaScript engine built from the ground up for speed\r\n\r\n* Malware and phishing lists that automatically update themselves and warn you of bad websites\r\n\r\n* A default homepage that displays your most commonly used sites and other personalized information\r\n\r\nGoogle chose to introduce Chrome to the media via [a comic book](http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/index.html) written by Scott McLeod.",
