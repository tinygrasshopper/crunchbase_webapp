Job Board Reviews was born out of necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\nSearching for a job is a very stressful endeavor. There are so many job boards out there \u2014 how do you know where to start and where NOT to waste your time. The creators of JBR's were tired of searching through so many job sites seeing the same exact jobs and paying to surface candidates from job boards that were simply \"stealing\"\u009d from other job sites. JBR is designed to help both job seekers and employers find the best possible job boards for their needs in every industry and position. We try to help solve the problem so many job seekers have of applying to jobs and never hearing a response and avoid employers wasting A LOT of time and money posting open positions that are never seen and never filled.",

Now candidates can find your jobs on their computers, phones and other mobile devices no matter how they look for a job: through search engines, vertical aggregators, social networking sites. And  the use of SEM allows passive candidates to be targeted while viewing associated web content.\r\n",
