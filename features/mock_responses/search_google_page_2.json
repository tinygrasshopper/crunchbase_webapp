Data is controlled with a microphone and touchpad on one arm of the frame so that users can select what to do with a brief gesture or by talking to the device.  There is 16GB of flash memory built into the device, with 12GB available for user storage.  The device syncs to Google Drive, and Bluetooth and WiFi are built in. \r\n\r\nGoogle Glass Explorer, the developer version sent out beginning in April of 2013, costs $1,500.    ",
